In my vector program, I attempted to create basic functionality such as calculating the x,y,magnitude, and direction given the arguments passed in the constructor or member functions. I also tried to implement operator overloads for addition, subtraction, and the outstream so that the vector class object can be output in the main method. Finally, I implemented an inherited class, unitVector, that inherits many of the same functionalities as the base class, but will be a normalized vector given the arguments passed through.
