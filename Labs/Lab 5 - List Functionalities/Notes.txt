1. Big-O for arraylist
-Extend = O(n), depends on iteration of the two arrays at least once, 2n -> n after removing constants
-min = O(n), depends on iteration of the array, n
-max = O(n), depends on iteration of the array, n
-count = O(n), depends on iteration of the array, n

2. Big-O for linkedList
-Extend = O(n), depends on iteration of the two linkedlists at least once, 2n -> n after removing constants
-min = O(n), depends on iteration of the list, n
-max = O(n), depends on iteration of the list, n
-count = O(n), depends on iteration of the list, n
